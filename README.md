* Note that some scripts will run better when their .c files are ran from the terminal.
* Certain .exe files will not open with their current scripts.
* If an .exe file doesn't open, it is preferred that .c file in the same folder is ran from the terminal.
* Certain scripts require command-line arguments to run, they have a README.md file included in their folders that will instruct what is required in the command-line argument.
* Each C folder includes cs50.c and the cs50.h library.
* The CS50x folder includes the mm_malloc.h library in case it is not located inside your stdio.h library.
* If mm_malloc.h is needed, move it to the current include path file directory being used for the include library.
