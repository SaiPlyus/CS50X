# /CS50x

* Each Lab and Problem Set have been confirmed to work in **CS50x's 2022 course**.
* Some files only will work inside of CS50x's codespace.
* File that do not work will be updated at a to-be-determined data.
* Each individual directory of every .exe file and .c file includes a cs50.c file and a cs50.h library.
* Move cs50.c and cs50.h form the CS50x directory to the current directory path being used for the include library of stdio.h.
* The CS50x directory includes the mm_malloc.h library in case it is not located inside the the directory path of the stdio.h library .
* If mm_malloc.h is needed, move mm_malloc.h from the CS50x directory to the current directory path being used for the include library of stdio.h.
* Here is a [walkthrough](https://github.com/cs50/libcs50/issues/189#issuecomment-737173845) to get the cs50.h library working in Visual Studio Code
* Note that some scripts will only run when their .c files are run from the terminal.
* Certain .exe files will not run or stay open with the current scripts.
* If an .exe file doesn't run or stay open, it is preferred that the user runs the .c file that is in the same parent directory location of the .exe file from terminal.
* Before attempting to run a .c file from terminal, the user must be in the current directory of the .c file that the user wants to run from terminal.
* Certain scripts require command-line arguments to run, they have a README.md file included in their parent directory that will instruct what the usage requirements are for the command-line arguements.
* All scripts .exe file that do not open or will not stay open will be updated at a later to be determined date so that each .exe file will work as intended.
